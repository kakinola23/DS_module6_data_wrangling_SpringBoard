# DS_module6_data_wrangling_SpringBoard

***From the analysis above, the original number of rows and columns in the data are 27 and 330 respectively. One of the columns that was removed was the fastEight column due to the fact that half of its values were missing. For the rows , some of them have the both prices(AdultWeekend, AdultWeekday) missing and they were dropped. Other issue found was that some of the states contain square brackets. This issue was resolved by removing the square brackets. To predict the ticket price, the variable AdultWeekend is a preferable feature in this case since it has less missing values which were dropped using the dropna() function. Lastly, at the end of the analysis, the rows left in the data were 25.***
